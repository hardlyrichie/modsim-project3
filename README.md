## Modeling the Asteroid Gravity Tractor Proposal  
Using the largest ion thrusted satellite in existence so far, what is the minimum time that we can know of an calamitous asteroid's existence so that the gravity tractor propsal would work?

How far in advance do we need to know about an earthbound asteroid for a gravity tractor method to work? (How long do we need to apply a 5.4N force to deflect an asteroid)
